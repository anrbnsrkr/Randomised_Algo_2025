*/ Inputs
The number of elements ware 50 within the range of 0 to 100, and the seed is -1(meaning random seed)
I created 3 permutations of the array.
key_gen = 11

*/Output:/*

The array is: 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18, 20, 21, 22, 25, 26, 28, 29, 31, 32, 33, 37, 38, 39, 44, 47, 50, 58, 59, 61, 65, 69, 72, 75, 76, 77, 79, 81, 83, 84, 87, 88, 91, 92, 93, 97, 98, 

The permutations are: 

P :  84, 79, 50, 93, 97, 26, 88, 3, 10, 69, 21, 65, 38, 16, 25, 83, 75, 22, 61, 11, 7, 8, 18, 33, 20, 92, 77, 44, 59, 6, 13, 76, 98, 29, 87, 39, 58, 81, 14, 47, 15, 91, 5, 28, 31, 37, 72, 4, 1, 32, 

P :  47, 38, 37, 93, 21, 84, 44, 7, 61, 39, 10, 76, 88, 3, 1, 4, 58, 69, 33, 5, 72, 31, 26, 8, 97, 25, 91, 87, 50, 16, 79, 11, 18, 6, 75, 28, 81, 32, 77, 15, 92, 22, 13, 29, 98, 14, 59, 83, 20, 65, 

P :  32, 93, 61, 5, 21, 10, 4, 16, 79, 83, 50, 3, 47, 29, 8, 75, 15, 91, 20, 72, 76, 6, 7, 88, 69, 92, 98, 87, 97, 28, 11, 59, 65, 26, 14, 39, 31, 84, 77, 33, 18, 1, 13, 22, 44, 38, 25, 81, 58, 37, 

Hash table is:
//table: //
0 : 11 -> 22 -> 33 -> 44 -> 77 -> 88 -> Length = 6
1 : 1 -> Length = 1
2 : 13 -> 79 -> Length = 2
3 : 3 -> 14 -> 25 -> 47 -> 58 -> 69 -> 91 -> Length = 7
4 : 4 -> 15 -> 26 -> 37 -> 59 -> 81 -> 92 -> Length = 7
5 : 5 -> 16 -> 38 -> 93 -> Length = 4

Bucket Len are: 
6, 1, 2, 7, 7, 4, 7, 4, 1, 4, 7, 


Number of collitions: 118
